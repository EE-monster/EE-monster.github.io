Welcome to a new project for me in 2024. Like so many people I have set myself a New Year's goal of finally capturing and sharing with the wider world everything tech related I am interested in, or things I just find shareworthy (is that even a word?). I follow a number of people, groups and organisations across platforms that have inspired my own growth over the years, and want this to be my way of paying it forward.

I’m not 100% sure where this journey will take me, but hopefully people will find something useful from my ramblings. And I finally, in a roundabout way, document some of the inner workings of the different things I use (in case I ever die my wife may need this - in her words to open the gate). Going forward I want to write about things I am working on or use both personally and professionally.

It will be mixture of themes and topics I cover as my interests are varied. The following is just the tip of the iceberg of ideas I would like to cover:


*	Smart home tech and gadgets
*	Home Automation
*	HomeLab
*	DevOps
* Artificial Intelligence
*	Modern Work + Security <i>(some more work related content</i>


## **Lesson 1 - A puma at large**
### **课文原文**
Pumas are large, cat-like animals which are found in America. When reports came into London Zoo that a wild puma had been spotted forty-five miles south of London, they were not taken seriously. However, as the evidence began to accumulate, experts from the Zoo felt obliged to investigate, for the descriptions given by people who claimed to have seen the puma were extraordinarily similar.

The hunt for the puma began in a small village where a woman picking blackberries saw ‘a large cat’ only five yards away from her. It immediately ran away when she saw it, and experts confirmed that a puma will not attack a human being unless it is cornered. The search proved difficult, for the puma was often observed at one place in the morning and at another place twenty miles away in the evening. Wherever it went, it left behind it a trail of dead deer and small animals like rabbits. Paw prints were seen in a number of places and puma fur was found clinging to bushes. Several people complained of ‘cat-like noises’ at night and a businessman on a fishing trip saw the puma up a tree. The experts were now fully convinced that the animal <i>was</i> a puma, but where had it come from? As no pumas had been reported missing from any zoo in the country, this one must have been in the possession of a private collector and somehow managed to escape. The hunt went on for several weeks, but the puma was not caught. It is disturbing to think that a dangerous wild animal is still at large in the quiet countryside.
